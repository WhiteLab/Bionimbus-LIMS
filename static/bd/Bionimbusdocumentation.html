  <p class="c0"><span>Bionimbus is a system for managing keys and
  data associated with bioinformatics datasets.</span></p>

  <p class="c0 c1"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>A dataset ( one or more files ) is associated
  with a key. &nbsp;A bionumbus key is the year the key was
  generated followed by the index. So the first key generated in
  2013 would be 2013-1, the 1000th, 2013-1000.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Keys have a plethora of metadata associated
  with them, such as antibody, treatment, organism, name, etc. What
  metadata is associated and required is based on the type of data
  associated with the Key, be it CHIpSeq. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Keys have security and limited visibility.
  &nbsp;Every key is a member of a project, and users can see keys
  that are public, or in which they are a member of the project
  that contains the key. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>If you navigate to the projects tab, you will
  see a list of the projects you have access to:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="272" src="images/image07.png" width=
  "717"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Scroll to the right, and you will see a
  libraries button, which will display the libraries associated
  with the project. &nbsp;You can also see all the libraries you
  have access to or a list of all the public libraries, via the
  &ldquo;libraries&rdquo; tab. &nbsp;If you do not have access to a
  project that contains the data you need, you need to contact an
  administrator to add you to the project. Please contact</span>
  <span class="c3"><a class="c4" href=
  "mailto:jhtuteja@uchicago.edu">jhtuteja@uchicago.edu</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or</span>
  <span class="c3"><a class="c4" href=
  "mailto:dhanley@uchicago.edu">dhanley@uchicago.edu</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span>and
  explain your connection to the project</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="288" src="images/image04.png" width=
  "716"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>You may have access to too many libraries to
  make scrolling through them practical. In this case, there is a
  sophisticated search function that allows you to find a set of
  libraries based off of any of the displayed metadata.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>If you click the search text area, you are
  presented with a query building tool. &nbsp;You can simply enter
  a textual query if you want, for example:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="183" src="images/image00.png" width=
  "715"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>For more sophisticated operations than
  looking for a simple string, you will want to use the query
  builder. &nbsp;Some fields, such as project and organism, cannot
  be searched with a simple text query. &nbsp;You can choose a part
  of a query, then populate the text box with it, then choose
  another part of a query, and whether you want to search it
  &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;or&rdquo; what is in the text box. So
  you can build a query like this:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>t_experiment_unit.f_project = "57" &nbsp;and
  t_experiment_unit.f_organism = "10"</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>And find the three records that match that.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="262" src="images/image03.png" width=
  "714"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>The main view when looking at a library only
  displays a subset of the available metadata based on the type of
  the library. &nbsp;If you scroll to the right, you will have the
  option to view more detailed metadata, view the files, edit the
  metadata, or download the files:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Viewing:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;If you click View you are presented
  with detailed metadata for the Library:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="595" src="images/image06.png" width=
  "717"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>From here, or from the previous screen, if
  you are the administrator, or a project admin, you can select
  edit to edit the library's metadata:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="752" src="images/image02.png" width=
  "719"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>From here, you can edit any of the
  library&rsquo;s metadata except the Bionimbus key. &nbsp;You can
  even change the project, which may cause you to lose access to
  the library, but is important as a way to clean up miscategorized
  data. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>To the left of the libraries are checkboxes.
  &nbsp;You can click one or more of these, then scroll to the
  bottom and click &ldquo;add to dropbox.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>This creates a collection of files associated
  with those keys. &nbsp;You will be taken right to the
  collection:</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="324" src="images/image01.png" width=
  "715"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>You can go back to libraries and choose more
  libraries &amp; files to add. &nbsp;Or, you can return to your
  dropbox by choosing &ldquo;selected files&rdquo; under
  &ldquo;libraries&rdquo;. &nbsp;You can scroll to the right and
  &lsquo;delete&rsquo; items from the dropbox--it will not delete
  the files. &nbsp;There is no way to delete files or keys in the
  system</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>There will be more options in the future,
  such as pushing collections of files to specific clouds,
  processing files, but from here, you can create a dropbox with
  &ldquo;make dropbox&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>What that will do is create a short URL that
  you can use to download all the files in the collection. &nbsp;It
  is a mechanism to allow sets of files to be shared with
  collaborators, or even transferred to other systems using
  mechanisms like get or curl.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Key generation</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>One of the most important functions of the
  bionimbus system is the generation of keys. &nbsp;To generate
  keys, the user needs access to the project the keys are to be
  generated in. &nbsp;If the user cannot select the project from
  the key generation page, she needs to contact an administrator to
  add her to the project.</span></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>To generate keys, the user must download and
  fill in a gey generation template spreadsheet. What sheet you
  download will be determined by the type of library you will be
  generating, RNAseq, DNAseq ,ChIPseq, or Exome. &nbsp;Furthermore,
  several options, such as Platform, Organism, Stage, and Facility
  are present on the interface, so if you are generating keys for
  Various organisms and Stages, you will need to create key
  generation spreadsheets for each of these. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><img height="1074" src="images/image05.png" width=
  "800"></p>

  <p class="c1 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>After filling this sheet in, you will proceed
  to a verification page that shows all your filled-in data plus
  the contents of your spreadsheet. &nbsp;</span></p>
