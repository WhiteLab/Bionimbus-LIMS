general setup and installation outline:

1) Install web2py. This can either be the standalone web2py or it can be a CGI/persistent CGI under an apache webserver. 
   if you don’t have python, it will be necessary to install it. 

2) Download and install Bionimbus-LIMS. 
   It’s likely that you already have done this if you are reading this file, but in any case, it is a good idea to make sure you 
   have the most current release.  

   After checking out or downloading and unzipping the directory, you can start the server in the base of the web2py directory with:
      “python web2py.py”

   You should only need to install one package, xlrd. This package is used by the key generation system to parse the metadata spreadsheets that 
   are used for key generation.  

3) The configuration file:

   some basic configurations are stored in config.dat these include:

sqlite = True / False 
   The default sqlite3 database the system uses will be adequate for all but the heaviest workloads, so it is unnecessary to use another database,
   such as postgres. If you need to use another database, set sqlite to False

postgres          = postgres://dstn:cisdstn@localhost:5432/bionimbus
  if you are using another database, set this to the database URI.  It doesn’t need to be postgres, but the name must remain postgres

login_with_openid = True
  If you are using the jainrain openid login ( included ) this will leu users log in with their gmail, facebook, twitter, etc id’s.  When logged 
  in, an admin will need to set their permissions so they can see their projects.  

api_key           = XXXXXXX
  This is used by the openid jainrain login system.  

domain            = bionimbus
  This is also used by the janrain system, to tell the server who to log in as 

scheme            = https
  This determines of we are using http or https by default to access the site
