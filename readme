This is the entire bionimbus distribution.  You can check it out from git directly into the applicaitons folder of 
web2py and run.  The only package that needs to be installed is the XLRD module for python to allow 
the generation of keys based on spreadsheets.  XLRD can be downloaded from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd

The package as deployed uses local login and a stabdalone SQLITE database that needs no configutation.  
In the base directory of the application there is a config.txt file for setting that allow you to use 
a postgres database, or an openid-based login system. In both cases, there is a line in the config
script you will need to configure to point to the local database, or your API key for the janrain 
openid system.

If you have an existing bioinformatics database, there is a sample import script for importing samples and 
experiments into the system, also in the applications folder.
